# Complete File Upload Fix - Multer Implementation

## üî• Problem Identified

Files were **NOT** being saved to the backend despite:
- ‚úÖ Multer configured correctly
- ‚úÖ Upload endpoint working
- ‚úÖ Directories being created

### Root Cause
The **auto-save feature** was serializing File objects to localStorage as plain objects `{name, size, type}`. When the form was restored from localStorage, these were **no longer File objects**, so they couldn't be uploaded!

```javascript
// BEFORE - File object gets corrupted
File ‚Üí localStorage ‚Üí {name, size, type} ‚Üí Can't upload! ‚ùå

// AFTER - File objects stay as Files
File ‚Üí Kept in memory ‚Üí File ‚Üí Uploads successfully! ‚úÖ
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend Logging (`backend/src/routes/files.ts`)

Added comprehensive logging to debug what the backend receives:

```typescript
router.post("/upload", upload.array("files", 10), async (req, res) => {
    console.log("=== FILE UPLOAD REQUEST RECEIVED ===");
    console.log("Request body:", req.body);
    console.log("Request files:", req.files);
    console.log("Files count:", req.files ? req.files.length : 0);
    
    const { applicationId, documentType = "other" } = req.body;
    const files = req.files as Express.Multer.File[];
    
    console.log("Application ID:", applicationId);
    console.log("Document Type:", documentType);
    console.log("Files received:", files ? files.length : 0);
    
    if (!files || files.length === 0) {
        console.error("No files in request!");
        // ... error handling
    }
    
    // ... after successful upload
    console.log("=== FILE UPLOAD SUCCESS ===");
    console.log("Files saved:", uploadedFiles.length);
    console.log("File paths:", files.map(f => f.path));
    console.log("Database records created:", uploadedFiles.map(f => f.id));
});
```

### 2. Frontend Upload Logging (`frontend/src/services/applications.ts`)

Added detailed logging before sending files:

```typescript
async uploadDocuments(applicationId: string, files: File[]) {
    console.log("=== UPLOAD DOCUMENTS CALLED ===");
    console.log("Application ID:", applicationId);
    console.log("Files array:", files);
    console.log("Files count:", files.length);
    console.log("File details:", files.map(f => ({
        name: f.name,
        size: f.size,
        type: f.type,
        isFile: f instanceof File  // ‚Üê Critical check!
    })));
    
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append("applicationId", applicationId);
    formData.append("documentType", "supporting_documents");
    
    files.forEach((file, index) => {
        console.log(`Appending file ${index}:`, file.name);
        formData.append("files", file);
    });
    
    // Log FormData contents
    for (let pair of formData.entries()) {
        console.log(pair[0], pair[1]);
    }
}
```

### 3. File Object Filtering (`frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts`)

Filter out serialized file metadata and only upload actual File objects:

```typescript
// In useApplicationSubmission hook
if (formData.documents.uploadedFiles && formData.documents.uploadedFiles.length > 0) {
    console.log("=== CHECKING UPLOADED FILES ===");
    console.log(`Found ${formData.documents.uploadedFiles.length} files`);
    
    // ‚≠ê Filter to only include actual File objects
    const actualFiles = formData.documents.uploadedFiles.filter(
        f => f instanceof File
    );
    console.log(`Actual File objects: ${actualFiles.length}`);
    
    if (actualFiles.length > 0) {
        await applicationService.uploadDocuments(
            result.applicationId,
            actualFiles
        );
        console.log("Documents uploaded successfully");
    } else {
        console.warn("No actual File objects found! Files may have been serialized.");
    }
}
```

### 4. Auto-Save Fix (`frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts`)

Mark serialized files with a flag:

```typescript
export const useAutoSave = (formData: FormData) => {
    useEffect(() => {
        const serializableData = {
            ...formData,
            documents: {
                ...formData.documents,
                uploadedFiles: formData.documents.uploadedFiles.map(file => {
                    if (file instanceof File) {
                        return {
                            name: file.name,
                            size: file.size,
                            type: file.type,
                            _isSerializedFile: true  // ‚≠ê Flag for restoration
                        };
                    }
                    return file;
                })
            }
        };
        
        localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(serializableData));
        console.log("Auto-save: Saved form data (files serialized as metadata)");
    }, [formData]);
};
```

### 5. Form Restoration Warning (`frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts`)

Warn users when files are lost from localStorage:

```typescript
export const useSavedFormData = () => {
    useEffect(() => {
        const saved = localStorage.getItem(key);
        if (saved) {
            const parsedData = JSON.parse(saved);
            
            // Check if files were serialized
            if (parsedData.documents?.uploadedFiles?.some(f => f._isSerializedFile)) {
                console.warn("‚ö†Ô∏è Uploaded files were lost during form restoration.");
                console.warn("You'll need to re-upload your files before submitting.");
                // Clear serialized metadata
                parsedData.documents.uploadedFiles = [];
            }
            
            setSavedData(parsedData);
        }
    }, [key]);
};
```

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Start Both Servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Fill the Form with Files

1. Go to http://localhost:5173
2. Fill Steps 1-4 (Employee, Patient, Treatment, Expenses)
3. **Step 5: Document Upload**
   - Check the required document checkboxes
   - Click "Choose Files"
   - Select 2-3 files (PDF, images)
   - Verify files appear in "Uploaded Files" list
4. Complete Step 6 (Declaration)
5. Click "Submit Application"

### Step 3: Watch Console Logs

**Frontend Console (Browser DevTools - F12):**
```
=== CHECKING UPLOADED FILES ===
Found 3 files in formData
Files: [File, File, File]
Actual File objects: 3

=== UPLOAD DOCUMENTS CALLED ===
Application ID: abc-123-def
Files count: 3
File details: [
  {name: "bill.pdf", size: 52341, type: "application/pdf", isFile: true},
  {name: "receipt.jpg", size: 189234, type: "image/jpeg", isFile: true},
  {name: "prescription.pdf", size: 67891, type: "application/pdf", isFile: true}
]

Appending file 0: bill.pdf
Appending file 1: receipt.jpg
Appending file 2: prescription.pdf

Upload response: {success: true, message: "3 file(s) uploaded successfully"}
Documents uploaded successfully
```

**Backend Terminal:**
```
=== FILE UPLOAD REQUEST RECEIVED ===
Request body: { applicationId: 'abc-123-def', documentType: 'supporting_documents' }
Request files: [ [Object], [Object], [Object] ]
Files count: 3

Application ID: abc-123-def
Document Type: supporting_documents
Files received: 3

=== FILE UPLOAD SUCCESS ===
Files saved: 3
File paths: [
  '/home/user/MedicalReimburse/backend/uploads/abc-123-def/bill-1728654321-987654321.pdf',
  '/home/user/MedicalReimburse/backend/uploads/abc-123-def/receipt-1728654322-123456789.jpg',
  '/home/user/MedicalReimburse/backend/uploads/abc-123-def/prescription-1728654323-456789123.pdf'
]
Database records created: ['uuid-1', 'uuid-2', 'uuid-3']
```

### Step 4: Verify Files on Disk

```bash
# Check uploads directory
ls -lah backend/uploads/<applicationId>/

# Should see:
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  51K Oct 11 10:30 bill-1728654321-987654321.pdf
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 185K Oct 11 10:30 receipt-1728654322-123456789.jpg
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  66K Oct 11 10:30 prescription-1728654323-456789123.pdf
```

### Step 5: Verify Database Records

```sql
-- Check application_documents table
SELECT 
    id,
    application_id,
    file_name,
    original_name,
    mime_type,
    file_size,
    document_type,
    uploaded_at
FROM application_documents
WHERE application_id = '<your-application-id>'
ORDER BY uploaded_at DESC;

-- Expected results:
-- 3 rows with file details
-- file_path should point to backend/uploads/<applicationId>/<filename>
-- document_type should be 'supporting_documents'
```

## üîç Debugging Guide

### Issue 1: "No files in request!" in backend

**Cause**: Files not reaching backend  
**Check**:
1. Frontend console - Are files File objects? `f instanceof File` should be `true`
2. FormData entries - Do they show `[object File]`?
3. Network tab - Request payload should show files

**Fix**:
```javascript
// Ensure files are File objects, not serialized metadata
const actualFiles = uploadedFiles.filter(f => f instanceof File);
```

### Issue 2: Directories created but empty

**Cause**: Multer not saving files  
**Check**:
1. Backend logs - Does it reach the success block?
2. Multer errors - Check for file type validation failures
3. Permissions - `chmod 755 backend/uploads`

**Fix**:
```bash
# Fix permissions
cd backend
chmod -R 755 uploads/
```

### Issue 3: "Files may have been serialized" warning

**Cause**: Form was restored from localStorage after page refresh  
**Impact**: File objects were lost during serialization  
**Solution**: User must re-upload files (this is expected behavior)

**Prevent**:
- Submit form immediately after uploading files
- Don't refresh page with files selected
- Files are session-only for security

### Issue 4: Upload succeeds but files not in database

**Cause**: Database insertion failing  
**Check**:
1. Backend terminal for database errors
2. RLS policies on `application_documents` table
3. Application ID exists in `medical_applications`

**Fix**:
```sql
-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'application_documents';

-- Should allow INSERT for anonymous users
```

## üìù Summary of Changes

| File | Change | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `backend/src/routes/files.ts` | Added console logging | Debug what backend receives |
| `frontend/src/services/applications.ts` | Added detailed logging | Track file upload process |
| `frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts` | Filter File objects | Only upload actual Files, not metadata |
| `frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts` | Flag serialized files | Warn on localStorage restore |
| `frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts` | Clear serialized files | Force re-upload after restore |

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] Files appear in frontend "Uploaded Files" list
- [ ] Browser console shows "Documents uploaded successfully"
- [ ] Backend console shows "FILE UPLOAD SUCCESS" with file paths
- [ ] Files exist in `backend/uploads/<applicationId>/`
- [ ] Database has 3 records in `application_documents`
- [ ] File sizes match original files
- [ ] MIME types are correct

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**: Follow testing instructions above
2. **Check logs**: Verify all console.log statements appear
3. **Verify files**: Check filesystem and database
4. **Test edge cases**:
   - Upload 1 file
   - Upload 10 files (max)
   - Try 11 files (should error)
   - Upload large file >10MB (should error)
   - Upload invalid file type (should error)

## üö® Important Notes

### File Persistence
- **Files are NOT saved in localStorage** (security + size limits)
- **Files are session-only** until form submission
- **After page refresh**, user must re-upload files
- **This is expected behavior** for file uploads

### Auto-Save Behavior
- ‚úÖ Form fields ARE saved and restored
- ‚ùå File objects ARE NOT saved (security)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è File metadata IS saved (for display only)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è User is warned when files are lost

### Upload Flow
```
1. User selects files ‚Üí File objects stored in memory
2. User fills other fields ‚Üí Auto-saved to localStorage (files as metadata)
3. User submits form ‚Üí Application created
4. Upload triggered ‚Üí Only actual File objects sent
5. Backend receives ‚Üí Multer saves to disk
6. Database updated ‚Üí Records created
7. Success response ‚Üí User notified
```
