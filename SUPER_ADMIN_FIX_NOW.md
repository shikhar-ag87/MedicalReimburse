# ⚡ QUICK FIX - Super Admin Not Seeing Application

## ✅ Fixed!

**Problem**: You approved from OBC (2nd time), but application not showing in Super Admin.

**Root Cause**: Super Admin was looking for wrong status (`back_to_obc` instead of `approved`).

**Solution**: Changed Super Admin to fetch `status: "approved"`.

## 🎯 What To Do Now

### Option 1: Refresh Browser (Recommended)
1. Go to Super Admin dashboard
2. **Hard refresh**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)
3. Look for "Pending Final Approval" section
4. Your application should appear with status badge "approved" 🟢

### Option 2: Re-approve from OBC
If hard refresh doesn't work:
1. Login as OBC
2. Find your application (should have status `approved`)
3. If status is still `back_to_obc`:
   - Click "Review"
   - Click "Accept & Forward" again
   - This will change status to `approved`
4. Now go to Super Admin dashboard
5. Should appear in "Pending Final Approval"

## 🔍 Verify Status

Check database to see current status:
```sql
SELECT 
    application_number,
    status,
    approved_amount,
    updated_at
FROM medical_applications
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Look for your application. The status column should show: **`approved`**

## ✅ Success Criteria

When it's working correctly, you should see:

**Super Admin Dashboard:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📋 Pending Final Approval        🟢 1 app   │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐│
│ │ YOUR-APP  │ Name │ ₹5,000 │approved│[Review]│
│ └─────────────────────────────────────────┘│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Status badge should be **green** with text **"approved"**.

## 📝 What Changed (Technical)

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/SuperAdminDashboard.tsx`

**Line 52** changed from:
```typescript
status: "back_to_obc",  // ❌ Wrong!
```

To:
```typescript
status: "approved",  // ✅ Correct!
```

## 🚀 No Restart Needed!

Frontend changes are hot-reloaded. Just refresh your browser:
- `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux)
- `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

Backend doesn't need restart either.
