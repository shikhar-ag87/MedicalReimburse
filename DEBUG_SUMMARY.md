## What I Did

Added **comprehensive console logging** at every step of the file upload process so we can see exactly where it's failing.

## How to Debug

### 1. Open Browser Console
Press **F12** → Go to **Console** tab → Clear it

### 2. Test the Upload
```bash
# Go to form
http://localhost:5173

# Steps:
1. Fill Steps 1-4 (any data)
2. Step 5: Click "Choose Files"
3. Select 2-3 files
4. Move to Step 6
5. Submit

# Watch the console!
```

### 3. What You Should See

**When selecting files:**
```
=== FILES SELECTED IN STEP 5 ===
Number of files: 2
isFile: true ✓
```

**When submitting:**
```
=== FINAL FORM SUBMISSION ===
Files are File objects?: [true, true] ✓
Actual File objects: 2 ✓
Uploading 2 files... ✓
```

**Progress bar should show:**
```
🔄 Uploading 2 file(s)... 75%
█████████████████████░░░░░░░
```

**Backend terminal should show:**
```
=== FILE UPLOAD REQUEST RECEIVED ===
Files count: 2 ✓
=== FILE UPLOAD SUCCESS ===
```

## 🐛 If Something's Wrong

The console logs will tell us EXACTLY where it breaks:

- **No "FILES SELECTED" log?** → Files not being selected properly
- **"Actual File objects: 0"?** → Files got serialized (localStorage issue)
- **No backend logs?** → Files not reaching server
- **No progress bar?** → Hook not updating

## 📋 What to Copy-Paste Back

After you test, send me:
1. **All console logs** (copy everything from Console tab)
2. **Backend terminal output** (what shows in backend terminal)
3. **Any red errors**
4. **Does progress bar show?** (Yes/No)

**The logs are very detailed now - they'll show us exactly what's happening!** 🔍
