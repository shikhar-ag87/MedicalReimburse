# 🎉 Upload Progress Bar - COMPLETE!

## ✅ What Was Added

### Visual Progress Bar During File Upload!

When you submit the form with files, you'll now see:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔄  Uploading 3 file(s)...  75%   │
│  ████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. Backend Hook (frontend/src/hooks/useApi.ts)
✅ Added `uploadProgress` state (0-100%)
✅ Added `uploadStatus` state (text message)
✅ Progress updates at each stage:
  - 0%: Initial
  - 50%: Application created
  - 60%: Starting file upload
  - 90%: Files uploaded
  - 100%: Complete!

### 2. Frontend UI (frontend/src/pages/EmployeeForm.tsx)
✅ Added progress percentage display
✅ Added progress bar animation  
✅ Added status message (e.g., "Uploading 3 file(s)...")
✅ Added smooth transitions
