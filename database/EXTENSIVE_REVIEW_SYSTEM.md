A: Check if review routes are registered in server.ts and authentication middleware is working.

**Q: Comments not threaded correctly?**
A: Verify parent_comment_id is set correctly when replying.

**Q: Timeline not updating?**
A: Check if the trigger `auto_create_review_timeline` is enabled.

**Q: Expense validation totals incorrect?**
A: The adjustment_amount is a GENERATED column - don't try to set it manually.
