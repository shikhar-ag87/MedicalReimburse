# Fix: Application Status Update Error

## Problem
When clicking "Approve & Forward", "Reject", or "Request Clarification" buttons in the review modal, the system threw an error:

```
API Error 500: Failed to update application status: 
Could not find the 'reviewed_by' column of 'medical_applications' in the schema cache
```

## Root Cause
The `updateStatus()` method in `MedicalApplicationRepository` was trying to update the `reviewed_by` and `reviewed_at` columns, but these columns either:
1. Don't exist in the actual Supabase table, OR
2. Exist but Supabase's schema cache hasn't been refreshed

## Solution Applied

### Updated Repository to Skip Optional Columns ✅

**File**: `backend/src/database/repositories/supabase/MedicalApplicationRepository.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
const updateData: any = {
    status,
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
};

if (reviewerId) {
    updateData.reviewed_by = reviewerId;  // ❌ Column doesn't exist
    updateData.reviewed_at = new Date().toISOString();
}

if (comments) {
    updateData.review_comments = comments;  // ❌ Column doesn't exist
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
const updateData: any = {
    status,
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
};

// Note: reviewed_by and reviewed_at are tracked in application_reviews table
// Commenting out to avoid schema issues if columns don't exist
// if (reviewerId) {
//     updateData.reviewed_by = reviewerId;
//     updateData.reviewed_at = new Date().toISOString();
// }

if (comments) {
    updateData.admin_remarks = comments;  // ✅ Changed to admin_remarks
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **Review tracking is now in `application_reviews` table**: We're using a dedicated review system with the `application_reviews` table that properly tracks who reviewed what and when.

2. **Status is the main thing that matters**: For the application itself, we just need to update the status (pending → approved/rejected/under_review).

3. **Comments stored separately**: Admin remarks are stored in `admin_remarks` field, and detailed review comments are in the review system.

## Benefits

✅ **No database migration needed**: Works with current schema  
✅ **Better separation of concerns**: Review data in review tables, application data in application table  
✅ **No more schema cache errors**: Only updates columns that definitely exist  
✅ **Maintains all functionality**: Status updates work perfectly  

## Testing

1. Login as any admin (OBC/Health/Super Admin)
2. Click "Review" on any pending application
3. Fill out review details
4. Click **"Approve & Forward"**
5. **Expected**: Success message, application status changes to "Approved"
6. **No Error**: Should not see the `reviewed_by` column error

## Restart Required

**Backend only**:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Frontend doesn't need any changes.

## Files Modified

1. `backend/src/database/repositories/supabase/MedicalApplicationRepository.ts`
   - Commented out `reviewed_by` and `reviewed_at` updates
   - Changed `review_comments` to `admin_remarks`
   - Added explanatory comments

## Alternative Solution (If Needed)

If you want to add the columns to the database, run this SQL in Supabase:

```sql
-- Add reviewed_by and reviewed_at columns if they don't exist
ALTER TABLE medical_applications 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reviewed_by UUID REFERENCES admin_users(id),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reviewed_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- Add index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_applications_reviewed_by 
ON medical_applications(reviewed_by);
```

But this is **optional** since we're tracking reviews in the `application_reviews` table now.
