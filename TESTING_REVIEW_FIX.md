## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Modal closes immediately after eligibility submit
**Solution**: Check that `onReviewComplete()` is NOT called in `handleEligibilitySubmit()`

### Issue: Application shows "reviewed" before clicking final buttons
**Solution**: Verify `reviewService.createReview()` is only called in `handleFinalDecision()`

### Issue: Status doesn't update after clicking Approve/Reject
**Solution**: 
- Check `adminService.updateApplicationStatus()` is being called
- Verify backend API `/api/applications/:id/status` is working
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Dashboard doesn't refresh
**Solution**: Verify `onReviewComplete()` is called in `handleFinalDecision()` after success
