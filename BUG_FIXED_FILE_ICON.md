# üêõ BUG FOUND & FIXED!

## The Problem

```javascript
import { Upload, File, CheckCircle, AlertCircle, X } from "lucide-react";
//                  ^^^^ 
//                  This was overriding the native JavaScript File object!
```

The Lucide icon component `File` was conflicting with JavaScript's native `File` object, causing this error:

```
Uncaught TypeError: File is not a function
```

When you tried to check `f instanceof File`, JavaScript was checking against the React component instead of the native File constructor!

## The Fix

Changed the import to use an alias:

```javascript
// BEFORE (broken)
import { Upload, File, CheckCircle, AlertCircle, X } from "lucide-react";

// AFTER (fixed)
import { Upload, File as FileIcon, CheckCircle, AlertCircle, X } from "lucide-react";
```

And updated the JSX:

```jsx
// BEFORE
<File className="w-5 h-5 text-gov-primary-600" />

// AFTER
<FileIcon className="w-5 h-5 text-gov-primary-600" />
```

Now `File` refers to the native JavaScript File object, and `FileIcon` refers to the Lucide icon!

## ‚úÖ Status

**FIXED!** No compilation errors.

## üß™ Test Again NOW!

```bash
# Refresh the browser (Ctrl+R or F5)
# The page should reload with the fix

# Then:
1. Go to Step 5
2. Click "Choose Files"
3. Select 2-3 files
4. Watch console - should now work!
5. Submit the form
```

## Expected Console Output

```javascript
=== FILES SELECTED IN STEP 5 ===
Number of files: 2
Files: [
  {name: "bill.pdf", size: 52341, type: "application/pdf", isFile: true},
  {name: "receipt.jpg", size: 123456, type: "image/jpeg", isFile: true}
]
Files added to formData.documents.uploadedFiles ‚úÖ
Total files now: 2

=== FINAL FORM SUBMISSION ===
Number of files: 2 ‚úÖ
Files are File objects?: [true, true] ‚úÖ

=== CHECKING UPLOADED FILES ===
Actual File objects: 2 ‚úÖ

=== UPLOAD DOCUMENTS CALLED ===
Uploading 2 files... ‚úÖ

// Progress bar shows:
Uploading 2 file(s)... 75% üîÑ
```

## Why This Happened

Classic JavaScript naming collision! 

- `File` = Native browser API for file objects
- `File` = Lucide React icon component

Both tried to use the same name, icon won the import, broke the file upload logic.

**Refresh your browser and try again!** Should work perfectly now! üöÄ
