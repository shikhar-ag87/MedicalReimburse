‚úÖ "Review created for application..."
‚úÖ "userObject": {role: "admin", userId: "..."}
```

### Browser Console

Check for:

```javascript
‚úÖ Response status: 200
‚úÖ Response data contains reviewId
‚ùå No CORS errors
‚ùå No 401 Unauthorized errors
```

### Database (Supabase)

After each test, check tables:

```sql
-- Reviews created
SELECT * FROM application_reviews ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Comments added
SELECT * FROM review_comments ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Documents reviewed
SELECT * FROM document_reviews ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Timeline populated
SELECT * FROM review_timeline ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## üêõ Common Issues

### ‚ùå "Supabase client not initialized"

**Fix**: Already fixed! Using `SupabaseConnection.getClient()` ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå "null value in column 'reviewer_id'"

**Fix**: Already fixed! JWT authentication added ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå "null value in column 'reviewer_role'"

**Fix**: Already fixed! Role extracted from JWT token ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå "relation 'application_reviews' does not exist"

**Fix**: Deploy `extensive_review_schema.sql` to Supabase ‚è≥

### ‚ùå 401 Unauthorized

**Cause**: JWT token expired or invalid
**Fix**: Re-login to get new token

### ‚ùå 404 Not Found

**Cause**: Wrong application ID or route
**Fix**: Check URL and verify application exists
