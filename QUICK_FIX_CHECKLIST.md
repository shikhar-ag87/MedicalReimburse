## üöÄ What You Need to Do (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Run the SQL Script

**If FIX_EVERYTHING.sql isn't working, use the step-by-step version:**

```
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Open this file: /home/aloo/MedicalReimburse/database/RUN_IN_PARTS.sql
4. Copy ALL content
5. Paste into SQL Editor
6. Click "Run"
7. Check output - it tells you what succeeded/failed
```

**Alternative (if you want to try the all-in-one):**
```
Use: /home/aloo/MedicalReimburse/database/FIX_EVERYTHING.sql
```

**What these scripts do:**
- ‚úÖ Adds missing status values (back_to_obc, reimbursed)
- ‚úÖ Fixes RLS policies
- ‚úÖ Resets admin passwords
- ‚úÖ Creates eligibility_checks table (NEW!)
- ‚úÖ Creates document_reviews table (NEW!)

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('eligibility_checks', 'document_reviews');
```

**Expected result:**
```
eligibility_checks
document_reviews
```

### Step 3: Restart Backend
```bash
cd /home/aloo/MedicalReimburse/backend
npm run dev
```

**Look for:**
```
‚úÖ Server running on port 3000
‚úÖ Supabase connection established
```

## üß™ Test It Works

### Test 1: Amount Display
1. Open any application in review modal
2. **Before Health Centre approval:** Should show "Amount Claimed: ‚ÇπX"
3. **After Health Centre approval:** Should show "Amount Approved: ‚ÇπY"

‚úÖ **PASS:** No more "Amount Approved: ‚Çπ0"

### Test 2: Review Persistence (THE BIG ONE!)
1. **OBC Initial Review:**
   - Login as OBC (obc@jnu.ac.in / obc123)
   - Open a pending application
   - Fill eligibility form completely:
     - Check all boxes
     - Select dropdown values
     - Add notes
   - Click "Complete Review"
   - Forward to Health Centre
   - **Remember what you filled!**

2. **Health Centre Review:**
   - Login as Health Centre (health@jnu.ac.in / health123)
   - Review the application
   - Return to OBC

3. **Verify Persistence:**
   - Login as OBC again
   - Open the SAME application (status: back_to_obc)
   - **üéØ CHECK:** Are your previous checkboxes still checked?
   - **üéØ CHECK:** Are your notes still there?
   - **üéØ CHECK:** Are dropdown values preserved?

‚úÖ **PASS:** All your review data should be exactly as you left it!

### Quick Reference:
- **Setup Guide:** `database/SETUP_REVIEW_PERSISTENCE.md`
- **Detailed Fix Log:** `REVIEW_PERSISTENCE_FIX.md`
- **SQL Script:** `database/FIX_EVERYTHING.sql`
- **Verification Script:** `database/verify_review_persistence.sql`

### If Something Goes Wrong:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check backend logs for database errors
3. Run `database/verify_review_persistence.sql` to diagnose
4. See troubleshooting section in `SETUP_REVIEW_PERSISTENCE.md`

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

After completing the steps above, you should have:

- [x] FIX_EVERYTHING.sql ran successfully in Supabase
- [x] Tables `eligibility_checks` and `document_reviews` exist
- [x] Backend restarted without errors
- [x] Amount shows "Claimed" instead of "‚Çπ0"
- [x] Review form persists data across workflow transitions
- [x] All previous functionality still works

## üéØ What Changed

### Frontend (`ComprehensiveReviewModal.tsx`)
- Smart amount display (claimed vs approved)
- Already had logic to load saved reviews (now backend returns real data!)

### Backend (`routes/reviews.ts`)
- GET `/eligibility/:id` now fetches from database
- PATCH `/eligibility/:id` now saves with upsert logic
- Uses service client to bypass RLS

### Database (NEW tables!)
- `eligibility_checks` - Stores all form data
- `document_reviews` - Stores document review states
- Both have RLS policies and indexes

---

## üö® Common Issues

### "relation 'eligibility_checks' does not exist"
**Fix:** Run FIX_EVERYTHING.sql in Supabase

### "permission denied for table eligibility_checks"
**Fix:** Check RLS policies are permissive (set to `true`)

### Form still empty after coming back
**Fix:** 
1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify `checker_id` in request matches logged-in user
3. Run verify_review_persistence.sql to check setup

### Backend won't start
**Fix:** Check for TypeScript errors, run `npm run build` to see issues

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Each reviewer gets their own saved state**
   - OBC's review is separate from Health Centre's
   - System shows the latest one by timestamp

2. **Data is never lost**
   - Even if you close the modal
   - Even if you logout
   - Even if application moves through workflow

3. **Backward compatible**
   - Old applications work fine
   - No data migration needed
   - New features only activate after SQL script run
